        <h3>Buill Front end website and JS Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I implement web designs through coding languages like HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. I am the person on your team who writes the code for a
          website’s navigation and layouts — a site looks different on your
          phone because a front end web developer made it so (thanks to
          mobile-first or responsive design).

          I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple
          website. I can even teach my best-friend how to make simple website.
          My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
